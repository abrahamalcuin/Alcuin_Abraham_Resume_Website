      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        We met quietly, grew steadily, and learned to listen to the gentle promptings that led us toward each
        other. Here is a glimpse into the moments that shaped our relationship and prepared us for the covenants we
        will make on our wedding day.

        <h2>His Side</h2>
        <p>
          Coming home from my mission, I knew that the next big step in my life would be finding an eternal companion.
          As I contemplated on who to date, I didnt have a specific person in mind, but I knew that I wanted someone who
          I can consider a true disciple of Jesus Christ. As I thought of those I knew, Patricia was the first person to
          come to my mind. Though we barely even talked during the mission, I knew that she was a missionary who gave
          her all in serving the Lord. I can still remember what I felt as she gave her departing testimony and bore witness
          of the Savior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite this, I didnt really have the courage to reach out to her. That is until one day, I was strongly prompted
          to do a social media fast because I was struggling to manage my time. I felt like I would benefit from living the
          same rules I lived on the mission. This meant that the only social media I was allowed to use would be Facebook
          Messenger. During the fast, I remember opening messenger and seeing Patricias profile; I felt a strong impression
          to reach out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pat is known for replying late...really late. You can ask any one of her friends and they would vouch for this.
          However, the timing was right, it was her rest day and she just happened to be on messenger. She replied to my
          message and we started talking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Barely being home from my mission, I honestly forgot how to maintain a chat conversation. Luckily, Pat is
          awesome, and knows exactly how to ask the right questions and keep the conversation going. She's always the 
          best at having spiritual conversations. She can turn any topic into a testimony about the Savior. From the start,
          it felt like we were already dating, even though we didnt make it official until 3 months later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even just talking to her made me feel like I wanted to be better. I knew that I couldnt keep wasting my time.
          She was already done with school and had a good job to boot. I wanted to grow and be worthy of dating someone
          like her. So I prayed and gave all my effort to find a job. Soon after I found a job that not only paid for my
          trips to the temple and allowed me to save up for college, but also taught me valuable life lessons that positively
          influence my life to this day.
        </p>
        <p>
          That experience, amongst others, helped me see that Patricia is the kind of person who can push me to be the best
          version of myself, to strive for discipleship, to work with diligence, and to apply the Atonement of Jesus Christ
          in my life. Over the course of our relationship, Ive truly seen how we both have grown. I know Pat will continue to
          help me grow and become more of a disciple of Jesus Christ. My only hope is that Im able to do the same for her.

        <h2>Her Side</h2>
        <p>
          Alcuin messaged me at a time when I was also drowning myself in social media. Youtube seemed like a nice place to
          keep my mind off of things. My family could attest to the fact that youtube was my alternative universe. So when
          Alcuin came into the picture, there was less of the reality I didnt want to find myself in and more of the life God
          intends for each of His children.
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldnt say that I am rid of my old vices, but dating and getting to know Alcuin has taught me more about the
          lessons we taught as missionaries, about change through faith and repentance in the Atonement of Jesus Christ, and
          even setting time for what we value most in life.
        </p>
        <p>
          At times when I struggle, Alcuins always been a consistent support in helping me remember what matters most.
          Changing may not look like having things go our way, but that even when things dont go the way we want it to go, we
          seek confirmation and instruction from our Father in Heaven to redirect our course back to His presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Alcuin proposed to me, he asked a question that reminded me of one of our purposes here on earthto help each
          other return to our Father in Heaven. I hope to be able to frequently look back on our experiences, both spiritual
          and temporal, to be reminded of how God is in the details of our lives and that He knows each one of us personally
