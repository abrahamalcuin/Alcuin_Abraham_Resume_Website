      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        We met quietly, grew steadily, and learned to listen to the gentle promptings that led us toward each
        other. Here is a glimpse into the moments that shaped our relationship and prepared us for the covenants we
        will make on our wedding day.

        <h2>From Quiet Hellos to Unmistakable Prompts</h2>
        <p>
          Our paths crossed at the Manila Institute of Religion where we both volunteered for a service project.
          A quick hello became a weekly conversation about classes, callings, and our favorite scriptures.
          There was no dramatic spark&mdash;just a growing sense of peace every time we spent time together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over shared jeepney rides and long walks after institute, we found matching priorities: faith before
          fear, family above busyness, and a deep desire to serve. Those little, ordinary choices built a friendship
          with extraordinary trust.
        </p>

                During a rainy hike we finally voiced what we both felt: the Lord was asking us to build a life together.

        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>
          We are excited for the quiet routines and big adventures ahead. We want a home where testimonies are shared
          over breakfast, music fills the kitchen, and friends always feel welcome. Most of all, we look forward to
          inviting the Savior into every plan we make.
